# Resources for Intro to R and ggplot Workshop

Thanks for participating in the workshop! Here are the resources that we used! I will leave them here so that you can have access to them in the future. 

## Contents: 

This folder contains:

- `workshop_script.R` : This is the Rscript that I was typing along with you. It does NOT contain everything that we went over. 
- `r_workshop_guide.html` : This is an html document that you can open in your browser window. It goes over everything that we worked through, including some additional things that we didn't get to. 
- `r_workshop_guide.Rmd` : This is the Rmarkdown document that produces the html file above. If you find yourself using R a lot in the future, you may want to learn how to make similar documents, so I am including it here for you. However, you can ignore it and just look at the html document for now. 
- `meme.jpg` : This is a meme that you will find in the guide. I'm including it here in case you want to try rendering the html file yourself. 

This folder also contains two small data sets that we will use in the workshop: 

- `flowering_data.txt`

This file contains a record of the date of first flower for several populations of Mimulus grown in the greenhouse last spring. The columns in the table are: Name (the name/ accession of the individual plant), Population (the population the plant was collected from), and Date_of_first_flower (the day that the first opened flower was observed on the plant).

- `germination_data.csv`

This file contains a record of germination (emergence of a plant from the seed) for the different Mimulus lines. The columns are: Name (the name/ accession of the individual plant), Population (the population the plant was collected from), Germinated (whether or not a plant emerged from any of the seeds), GA_treated (whether or not the seeds were treat with gibberellic acid, which can help the seeds break dormancy).
